0,In this farewell There's no blood There's no alibi â€~Cause I've drawn regret From the truth Of a thousand lies  So let mercy come And wash away  What I've done I'll face myself To cross out what I've become Erase myself And let go of what I've done  Put to rest What you thought of me While I clean this slate With the hands Of uncertainty  So let mercy come And wash away  What I've done I'll face myself To cross out what I've become Erase myself And let go of what I've done  For what I've done I start again And whatever pain may come Today this ends I'm forgiving what I've done  I'll face myself To cross out what I've become Erase myself And let go of what I've done  (Na-na na na) (Na-na na na) (Na-na na na) What I've done   (Na-na na na)  (Na-na na na) (Na-na na na)   (Na-na na na) Forgiving what I've done   (Na-na na na)  (Na-na na na) (Na-na na na) (Na-na na na) (Na-na na),linkin-park
1,"When you were standing in the wake of devastation When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying, ""Save me now"" You were there, impossibly alone  Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go, let it go  And in a burst of light That blinded every angel As if the sky had blown The heavens into stars  You felt the gravity of tempered grace Falling into empty space No one there to catch you in their arms  Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go, let it go  Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go, let it go Let it go, let it go, let it go  Do you feel cold and lost in desperation? You build up hope, but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration And let it go, let it go",linkin-park
2,"Yeah, yeah  This is not the end This is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot Rocking every revision  But you listen to the tone And the violet rhythm And though the words sound steady Something empty's within 'em  We say, yeah With fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something That's invisible there  'Cause we're living at the mercy Of the pain and the fear Until we dead it, forget it Let it all disappear, yeah  Waiting for the end to come Wishing I had strength to stand This is not what I had planned It's out of my control  Flying at the speed of light Thoughts were spinning in my head So many things were left unsaid It's hard to let you go  I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I wanna do is trade This life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  Sitting in an empty room Trying to forget the past This was never meant to last I wish it wasn't so  I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I wanna do is trade This life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  Yeah, yeah What was left when that fire was gone? I thought it felt right but that right was wrong All caught up in the eye of the storm And trying to figure out what it's like moving on  And I don't even know what kind of things I've said My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead So picking up the pieces, now where to begin The hardest part of ending is starting again  All I wanna do is trade This life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  This is not the end This is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot Rocking every revision  But you listen to the tone And the violet rhythm Though the words sound steady Something empty's within 'em  We say, yeah With fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something That's invisible there  'Cause we're living at the mercy Of the pain and the fear Until we dead it, forget it Let it all disappear",linkin-park
3,"I remembered black skies, the lightning all around me I remembered each flash as time began to blur Like a startling sign that fate had finally found me And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve  So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide  There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow And the ground caved in between where we were standing And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve  So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new divide  In every loss, in every lie, in every truth that you'd deny And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve  So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide Across this new divide, across this new divide",linkin-park

6,"It starts with One thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time  All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away  It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, but didn't even know Or wasted it all just to watch you go  I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter  One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To remind myself how  I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised  It got so far Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end  You kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be A memory of a time when  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter  I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There's only one thing you should know  I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There's only one thing you should know  I tried so hard and got so far But in the end it doesn't even matter I had to fall to lose it all But in the end it doesn't even matter",linkin-park
7,"""We knew the world would not be the same.  A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent.  I remember the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""

8,"From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts Taken far from my safety, the picture's there The memory won't escape me  We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly see The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe And as the rain drips acidic questions around me I block out the sight of the powers that be  And duck away into the darkness, times up I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend And the eyes ease open and it's dark again  From the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts Taken far from my safety, the picture's there The memory won't escape me but why should I care?  In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up The darkness holding me tightly until the sun rises up  Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs I'm nauseated by the polluted rock that's all around Watchin' the wheels of cars that pass, I look past To the last of the light and the long shadows it casts  A window grows, captures the eye And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box Inside a building of rock with antennas on top  Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game And while the inside's changed, the box stays the same And the figure inside could bear anybodys name  The memories I keep are from a time like then I put on my paper so I could come back to them Someday, I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again  Yo, from the top to the bottom, bottom to top, I stop At the core I've forgotten, in the middle of my thoughts Taken far from my safety, the picture's there The memory won't escape me  I'm here at this podium talking the ceremonial offerings Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring What's happening? City governments are eternally napping Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapsing  Bullets that scar souls with dark holds, get more than Your car stole, some hearts be blacker than charcoal For real, this society's deprivation depends Not on our differences but the separation within  No preparation is made, limited aid and minimum wage Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid Tragedy within a parade, the darkness overspreads Like a permanent plague, I'm the forgotten  In the memory you'll find me, eyes burning up The darkness holding me tightly until the sun rises up",linkin-park
9,Waking in a sweat again Another day's been laid to waste In my disgrace  Stuck in my head again Feels like I'll never leave this place There's no escape I'm my own worst enemy  I've given up I'm sick of feeling Is there nothing you can say?  Take this all away I'm suffocating! Tell me what the heck is Wrong with me?

City governments are eternally napping Trapped in greedy covenants causing urban collapsing  Bullets that scar souls with dark holds Get more then your car stole Some hearts be blacker than charcoal For real, this society's deprivation depends Not on our differences but the separation within  No preparation is made, limited aid and minimum wage Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid Tragedy within a parade The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague I'm the forgotten  In the memory you'll find me Eyes burning up The darkness holding me tightly Until the sun rises up",linkin-park
